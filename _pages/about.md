I am a machine learning scientist. 
I am currently working as an Assistant Professor at Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. 
My research aims to develop robust and generalizable machine learning models and algorithms that solve challenging real-world problems. 
I have been focusing on several research topics, including multi-modal learning, sequential data analysis, and graph analysis. 
In terms of methodology, I'm interested in computational optimal transport, temporal point processes, and their applications in various domains.

I received my PhD and BE in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), in 2016 and 2010, respectively, where I was jointly supervised by Prof. Wenjun Zhang (SJTU), Prof. Hongyuan Zha (Georgia Tech) and Prof. Xiaokang Yang (SJTU). 
After that, I spent four incredible years at University of Toronto and Duke University as a postdoctoral fellow.

**I am recruiting talented and well-motivated undergrad/graduate students to work with on interesting research projects! 
If you are interested, please drop me an email with your CV.**
