I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Dixin's Lab, where I've been since September 2024. Before this journey, I completed my Bachelor's degree at the Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests lie in series generation and AIGC, topics that genuinely excite me. Beyond academics, I have a deep passion for sports, and I truly admire Stephen Curry as my favorite player. It's always inspiring to see someone excel in their craft!
