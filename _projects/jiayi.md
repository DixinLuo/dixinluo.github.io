I earned my bachelor's degree from NUAA and joined the Dixin Lab as a master's student at BIT in August 2022. My research primarily focuses on transfer learning and generative modeling. Currently, I have a strong interest in AIGC, especially in controllable image generation.

Additionally, I'm a big fan of baseball, the show Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and the bands Green Day and Oasis!
