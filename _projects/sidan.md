I earned my Bachelor's degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology and have been pursuing my Master's degree since September 2023. My research interests include multi-modal representation learning, multi-modal data classification and retrieval, and AI-generated content (AIGC). I have a strong passion for Haikyuu!!, The Legend of Zelda, and the literary works of Albert Camus.
