I am currently pursuing my master's degree at the Beijing Institute of Technology and had the pleasure of joining Dixin's Lab in September 2024. I am genuinely passionate about exploring multimodal representation learning and large multimodal models, particularly their applications in the medical field, where they can make a significant impact. Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing badminton, as it helps me stay balanced and connected with others.
