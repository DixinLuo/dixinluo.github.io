I am a senior undergraduate student at the Beijing Institute of Technology, expecting to graduate in June 2025. After graduation, I plan to continue my graduate studies at the same institution. My major during my undergraduate studies is Software Engineering, and my research focus for my graduate studies will be on multimodal large models.
