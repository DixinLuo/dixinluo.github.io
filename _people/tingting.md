I joined Dixin's Lab in October 2022 while I was an undergraduate student at Beijing Institute of Technology. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree. My research interests include graph learning, contrastive learning and optimal transport.  Yoga and meditation are integral parts of my life, helping me maintain balance and focus.
