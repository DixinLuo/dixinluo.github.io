I am currently a third-year M.S. student at the School of Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology, where I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests are focused on point processes, optimal transport, and causal inference, areas in which I am confidently expanding my expertise and making meaningful contributions.
