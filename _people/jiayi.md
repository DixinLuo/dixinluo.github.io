I received my bachelor's degree from NUAA and joined the Dixin Lab as a MS student in BIT since August 2022. My research mainly focuses on transfer learning and generative modeling. Currently, I am deeply interested in AIGC, particularly in controllable image generation.

TMI: I am a big fan of baseball, Brooklyn 99, GreenDay and Oasis!
